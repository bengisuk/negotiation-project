A relatively new and evolving branch of Artificial Intelligence is automated negotiation. In automated negotiation, two or more agents negotiate about a multi-issue problem in order to find a solution that maximizes their utility. The utilities for each possible bid are determined using a human-defined preference profile, which consists of weights for each of the issues and a utility for each possible value of the issues. 

In this report we describe the process of creating an agent for automated negotiation. \Autoref{sec:exercises} contains the answers to the questions posed in the assignment concerning the party domain and genius in general. 
\Autoref{sec:strategy} describes the strategy our agent uses. The main chapter contains the high-level description of the agent. In it's subsections, \autoref{sec:strategyAS}, \autoref{sec:strategyBS}, \autoref{sec:strategyOM} and \autoref{sec:strategyOMS}, we go into more detail about the specific BOA components. \Autoref{sec:performance} shows the results of performance tests of our final agent against some other agents that were included in genius. In \Autoref{sec:conclusion} we describe our experience regarding building the agent and decide what is needed in order to use our agent in real world negotiations.
