While an opponent strategy model is not required for a good negotiation agent we have decided to implement a simple version of this component. Our strategy model has one method \texttt{getOpponentModel()} that approximates the behaviour of the opponent. \\

While testing our agent we noticed that hardheaded opponents do not offer a large number of different bids, i.e. they stick to bids that have high utility for themselves. On the other hand, agents that act as conceder offer a wide variety of bids due to their conceding behaviour. Our strategy model uses this information to determine the strategy of the opponent. \\

Our strategy model first fetches the bid history of the oponent, then these results are filtered on time. Only opponent bids that were offered before $t=0.6$ are taken into account. Then our helper function \texttt{getDistinctBids()}.
