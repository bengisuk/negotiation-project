\subsection{Concluding: Future Perspectives}

\subsubsection{Other capabilities}

We think that extending agents with more communication abilities would not 
increase the perfromancy very much. When automated agents communicate,
you would need to define a protocol so they can understand eachother.
Agents could communicate things like: if you do this, I will concede here, etc...
However, using the current method of exchanging bids, this already becomes 
appararent. The advantage of working with bids is agents are sure and that they are final,
when communicating, agents can lie and take advantage of eachother. 
We think that this will lead to no communication at all because of this danger.
One type of communication that would be useful is maybe that agents
tell eachother what bids they deem unacceptable. 
After communicating this, the agents will never offer these bids because they know
their opponent will never accept these. This way, 
agents will know what bids are unacceptable for the opponent, and this way
the domain size can be reduced. 
However, another way to look at this is that the domain is not specified well for the 
negotation if this is the case. Before you negotatiate, you need to specify the issues
and values for these issues, and if you include values that are not acceptable to 
yourself as negotatior, this is useless. However, one can imagine cases where
there is a default domain. For example, when buying a car, one could have a default domain
where all possible values for all possible cars are specified, and that this domain is 
downloaded to your pocket negotatior. Then this would be very useful,
to make negotations much faster.

\subsection{Conclusions}

For this project we performed an in-depth study in the world of automated negotiation. After reading a large amount of literature written about the subject we have designed and implemented our own agent using the BOA framework and \texttt{Genius} environment. It became clear to us that negotiation is not as straight forward as it might seem at first glance. Finding outcomes that are a win-win situation for both parties can be hard. The complexity of the BOA components are expressed in the amount of different parameters, depending on a lot of factors. These factors are optimized in the testing phase.  \\

Our agent, the BOAconstructor, combines multiple existing ideas.
