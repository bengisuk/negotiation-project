\subsection{Concluding: Future Perspectives}










\subsection{Conclusions}

For this project we performed an in-depth study in the world of automated negotiation. After reading a large amount of literature written about the subject we have designed and implemented our own agent using the BOA framework and \texttt{Genius} environment. It became clear to us that negotiation is not as straight forward as it might seem at first glance. Finding outcomes that are a win-win situation for both parties can be hard. The complexity of the BOA components are expressed in the amount of different parameters, depending on a lot of factors. These factors are optimized in the testing phase.  \\

Our agent, the BOAconstructor, combines multiple existing ideas.
