Our bidding strategy is time dependent, we have implemented three phases each of which uses its own strategy for offering bids. The main \texttt{Group7\_BS} class chooses the strategy by evaluating the normalized time (\texttt{getTime()}) and the two hard-coded phase thresholds stored in the array \texttt{phaseBoundary}. In this section we discuss the strategy behind each of the phases separately.

\subsubsection{First Phase}
Our agents first bid is determined by the method \texttt{determineOpeningBid()}. By offering a bid of maximal utility the opponent can easily estimate our preference profile. Due to this reason we have chosen to offer an initial bid of utility $0.9$. The best bid of this utility is obtained by calling \texttt{getBidNearUtility()} of the \texttt{OutcomeSpace} class. \\

After determining our openings bid and receiving the initial bid from the opponent our agent continues by generating random bids. These random bids are generated within a small utility range. The (average) height of this range decreases by a small amount when time passes. The range is calculated by the method \texttt{getBidRange()} given in Listing~\ref{code:getrangefunctionfirstphase}. After calculating the range, the \texttt{getRandomBid()} method is used to generate a bid within this range. \\

We set the parameters such that in the beginning bids are generated around an utility of $1$, that is $[0.98, 1.0]$, and then gradually decreases towards the end. At the end of the phase the bids are centered around an utility of $0.9$ which corresponds to $[0.88, 0.92]$. As these numbers indicate, we set the margin of the bid range to $0.02$. \todo{Update this, we now also look at the best bid of the opponent.}

  double normTime = t/this.phaseEnd; // Normalized time
  
  // Center of the utility range

  BidDetails bestOpponent = negotiationSession.getOpponentBidHistory().getBestBidDetails();
  
  // Set the bounds for the range
  double lb = val-margin;
  double ub = val+margin;
  
  if (bestOpponent.getMyUndiscountedUtil() > val){
    // The opponent has offered a better bid (for us)
    // than the center of our bid range, we counter this
    // by choosing a bid higher (+0.05) than the opponents bid.
    val = bestOpponent.getMyUndiscountedUtil()+0.05;
    
    // Update boundaries
    lb = val; ub = val+margin;
  }
  
  // Range in which bids are randomly generated
  Range r = new Range(lb, ub); 
  
  // Set upper bound to 1 if it exceeds upper bound
  if (r.getUpperbound() > 1) r.setUpperbound(1.0);
  
  return r;
