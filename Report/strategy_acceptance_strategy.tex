During the development of our acceptance strategy BOA component, \todo{AC\_BOAconstructor}, we designed, implemented and tested many different acceptance conditions. One more genius than the other. Some failed horribly, but some worked nicely. Within this paper we will only discuss the acceptance conditions that made it into the final product that was delivered along with this report. 

Our acceptance strategy component consists of 7 acceptance conditions that are mainly based on the acceptance conditions as found in \cite{baarslag2013acceptance}. However, we modified most of these slightly to accomodate for our beliefs. To the best of our knowledge, in theory, they should all perform better.

In the following subsections, we will first discuss each of these conditions.

\subsubsection{AC Curve}
This acceptance condition is based on the trivial \todo{AC\_const}, but we add an extra dimension by letting it depend on the normalized current time, \todo{t\_current}, of the negotiation. We created a formula that would exponentially decrease when \todo{t\_current} close to \todo{t = 1.0}
